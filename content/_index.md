### Price

Free of charge, funded by the [Nordic e-Infrastructure
Collaboration](https://neic.no/).


### Hackathon goals and format

From FAIR principles to FAIR in practices. This hackathon is a combination of training (March 11, 2021) and 
hands-on using real Climate data (16-17 March, 2021)!

The goal is to take a bottom up approach to explore how the current
international standards and tools for managing climate model output (including 
[ES-DOC](https://www.earthsystemcog.org/projects/es-doc-models/), [CF](https://cfconventions.org/),
[CMOR](https://cmor.llnl.gov/), [ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov/), etc.) can
be reused in Nordic and national research projects to help ensure the valuable climate model
outputs are FAIR and open. We will use real world output from two global climate models 
([NorESM](https://www.noresm.org/) and [EC-Earth](http://www.ec-earth.org/)) and plan to work through 
the process of generating comprehensive metadata from the raw model simulation output. 
How metadata generation fits into research workflow and data management will also be considered.

A report on the outcomes of this hackathon will be written and made publicly available.

### Requirements

There is no need to install anything but:
- You need a laptop (or any desktop!) with a modern browser to access the [EOSC-Nordic JupyterLab](https://eosc-nordic.uiogeo-apps.sigma2.no/hub/login).
- Once registered and close to the event, you will receive some information on how to access the Climate JupyterLab.

### Who the hackathon is for

From FAIR experts to Climate modellers.

Are you doing one of these things below:
- You help researchers to make their data FAIR.
- You write to process climate data.
- You change scripts written by your colleagues.
- You write code that is used in climate research by you or others.

If yes, then this hackathon is for you.

### How to join

We have a limited number of seats. Priority seats are given to NICEST2 staff.

To ensure a balanced mix of participants we warmly invite both climate researchers and research data managers.
